# Python-MIPS-Simulator
 The provided code is a high-level simulator for a MIPS-based CPU. It fetches and executes instructions from a file, manages memory access via a memory bus, and controls cache operations. The primary aim is to demonstrate how a MIPS CPU processes instructions, communicates with memory, and handles cache interactions.
